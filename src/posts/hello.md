Hello everyone, and welcome to my blog. Here I will talk about developing, designing, cool products to help you, show you how my websites work, etc.

Let me introduce myself, my name is Kabir Shah, and I enjoy making things that help people. I always learn something new and spend more time refactoring it and making it better. My top projects are featured [on my personal website](http://kabir.ml).

I am a student in Sunny California.

Now, more about this blog. Here you will find in-depth tutorials on things that are useful, including

- useful code snippets
- walkthroughs on my websites
- tutorials on creating websites/web apps/mobile apps from scratch

Thanks for reading this short post, and stay tuned for more blog posts!
