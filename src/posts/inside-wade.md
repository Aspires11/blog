[Wade](https://github.com/KingPixil/wade) is a 1kb Javascript search library. It allows you to search for a query through a set of documents. This query is processed, split into keywords, and then searched within an index structure.

### API

The API is extremely minimal and self-explanatory. It looks like:

```js
const search = Wade(["He saves on socks.", "You are being silly."]);
search("save socks");
```

### Processor

Wade processes all documents and queries. This works by moving each item through a separate processing function. These do the following operations:

* Make everything lowercase.
  This helps with searching. All queries and data are made lowercase, resulting in the search not being case-sensitive.
* Remove punctuation.
  Punctuation is usually irrelevant to the search query and does not need to be searched for.
* Remove stop words.
  Wade has a list of stop words that are removed from all data and queries. Stop words are extra words that have little meaning or can apply to any item in the data, and removing them allows for more relevant results to be returned. These can be configured through `Wade.config.stopWords`.

#### Example

When given the data:

```js
["Moon... is the best!", "Slash is the best!", "Spark is the best.", "Wade is the best?", "The Wing is the best"]
```

It is processed into:

```js
["moon best", "slash best", "spark best", "wade best", "wing best"]
```

Notice how everything is lowercase, does not contain punctuation, and does not contain stop words.

### Index

After processing the data, an index can be generated to allow for optimized searches within a text. This index can be generated by:

1. Processing each document.
2. Splitting each document into a multiset of terms.
3. Generating a trie of the terms and storing the indexes of the corresponding documents containing the term.
4. Storing the weighted significance of the term in the documents.

A _set_ is used to store multiple unique items. The _cardinality_ of a set represents the amount of elements in the set.

On the other hand, a _multiset_ is used to store multiple items (including duplicates). The _multiplicity_ of an item in a multiset is the number of instances of that item in the multiset.

#### Significance

Wade uses a special function to find how significant a term is to the data. This function takes in many factors, including the length of the documents, the length of a specific document with the term, and the number of occurrences of the term.

The significance of the term _t_ in the set of documents _d_ can be represented by the function:

```math
wm(t, d) = 1.5 - \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{|d|} [\frac{\mu(t)}{\sum_{p \in d_i}(\mu(p))}]}{|d|}
```

1. `$f$` is a set of multisets `$d_i$`
2. `$t \in d_i$` for at least one `$d_i$`
3. `$\mu(t)$` is the multiplicity of `$t$` in the multiset `$d_i$`
4. `$\sum_{p \in d_i}(\mu(p))$` is the cardinality of the multiset `$d_i$`
5. `$\frac{\mu(t)}{\sum_{p \in d_i}(\mu(p))}$` is the ratio of occurrences of the term `$t$` in the document `$d_i$` to the total amount of terms in the document `$d_i$`

This works by finding the average of how often the term appears within a document. After this, the significance is normalized between `$0.5$` and `$1.5$`, allowing it to become higher when the average occurrence is lower. This allows for rarer terms to be amplified in significance.

#### Example

When given the processed data:

```js
["moon best", "slash best", "spark best", "wade best", "wing best"]
```

An index is generated:

```js
{
  "m": {
    "o": {
      "o": {
        "n": {
          "data": [
            1.4,
            0
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "b": {
    "e": {
      "s": {
        "t": {
          "data": [
            1,
            0,
            1,
            2,
            3,
            4
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "s": {
    "l": {
      "a": {
        "s": {
          "h": {
            "data": [
              1.4,
              1
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "p": {
      "a": {
        "r": {
          "k": {
            "data": [
              1.4,
              2
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "w": {
    "a": {
      "d": {
        "e": {
          "data": [
            1.4,
            3
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "i": {
      "n": {
        "g": {
          "data": [
            1.4,
            4
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is a map of every single character, so that they can be searched through individually. At the end of a specific term, there is a `data` property. The first item in this array is the significance of the term. The other items are the indexes of the documents in which the term appears.

Notice how the unique terms `"moon"`, `"slash"`, `"spark"`, `"wade"`, and `"wing"` all have a higher weight of `1.4`. In contrast, the term `"best"` appears in all of the documents half of the time, and has a lower weight of `1`.

### Search

To be done

### Conclusion

In a nutshell, Wade processes data, splits it into terms, and creates an index containing the indexes of the items along with how relevant each term is to the data. A query is also processed and split into terms. These terms are individually searched within the index and the scores are updated as needed.
